Underscore Bookshelf
====================

* Use _.each to iterate over each book and display it in the bookshelf. Add a class book so that you can easily find them later.
* Use _.filter to find all the books with a rating of 4 or 5, and add a CSS class to them called hot. Add CSS so that the hot class is a snazzy star shape or something.
* Implement a front-end filter that filters the books by title. Add a search box with an ID, and use its value to filter those books that match the title.
* Use _.template to enchance your code a bit.
* Can you refactor the code for a Book into an object?
* These instructions will self-destruct in 10 seconds.
